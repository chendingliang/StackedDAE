# StackedDAE
Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder based on TensorFlow

This project is intended to be a Bioinformatics tool. However, this repository hosts the project's code, which is not strictly binded to biology, so someone could use it for another purpose with little effort (on the other hand it's not generalized so to fit in every occasion, so a bit of effort is required).

Also, in our project we try to find a good setup for the algorithm, so there are a lot options (and there are more to come) implemented in the code. Masking and Salt-and-pepper noise, with or without Emphasis, and Sigmoid or Tahn activation functions to name a few.
